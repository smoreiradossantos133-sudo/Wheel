# Building wheelc for macOS

Since this is a Linux container, we cannot build for macOS architecture (x86_64-apple-darwin).

To build wheelc for macOS, do the following ON A NATIVE MAC:

1. Clone the Wheel repository:
   git clone https://github.com/smoreiradossantos133-sudo/Wheel.git
   cd Wheel

2. Install Rust (if not already installed):
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

3. Build the release binary:
   cargo build --release

4. Copy to dist/MacOS:
   cp target/release/wheelc dist/MacOS/wheelc
   chmod +x dist/MacOS/wheelc

5. Commit and push to repository:
   git add dist/MacOS/wheelc
   git commit -m "Add macOS x86_64 executable"
   git push

Alternatively, you can use GitHub Actions CI to build automatically.
